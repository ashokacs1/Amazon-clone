When you push a project to GitHub, it is standard practice to include a **README.md** file. This file acts as the "homepage" of your project, explaining what it is and what technologies you used.

Since you are building an **Amazon Clone**, here is a professional, well-structured "Read Me" content you can copy and paste into a new file named `README.md` in your project folder.

# Amazon Clone - UI/UX Practice

A front-end clone of the **Amazon.com** homepage and footer, built to master the art of complex layouts and responsive web design.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a pixel-perfect recreation of the Amazon web interface. The goal was to practice semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques to handle dense information and multi-layered navigation.

### Key Features

* **Navigation Bar:** Includes the search bar, account lists, and location selector.
* **Hero Section:** A responsive image slider/carousel effect.
* **Product Grids:** Flexbox-based cards showing various product categories.
* **Detailed Footer:** Multi-column link sections, language/currency selectors, and the copyright panel.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes using Media Queries.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For semantic structure (using `header`, `footer`, `nav`, and `section` tags).
* **CSS3:** * **Flexbox:** Used for the navigation and footer alignment.
* **CSS Grid:** Used for the main product display area.
* **Custom Properties (Variables):** To manage Amazon's specific color palette.
* **Positioning:** For sticky headers and overlay effects.

## 💡 What I Learned

* How to manage a large number of links using **nested lists**.
* The importance of **text-align** and **flex-direction** in centering complex footer elements.
* How to solve the "image path" issue when working with multiple folder levels in VS Code.
* Using **Git** and **GitHub** to version control a multi-file project.
